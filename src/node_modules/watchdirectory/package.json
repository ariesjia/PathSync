If true then we notify the callback of files during initial directory walk.\r\n* `'recursive'` - Defaults to true.  Controls the depth of our directory walk.\r\n* `'filter'` - Can be a function or RegExp or string.  If it's a string then that will be considered an extension to check.  Your callback will only be notified about files that pass your filter.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\n  var unwatch = watchdirectory.watchDirectory('src', {filter:'.js'}, function (filename, curr, prev, change) {\r\n    if (change == 'initial') {\r\n      // filename found during initial pass\r\n    }\r\n    else if (change == 'created') {\r\n      // filename is a new file\r\n    }\r\n    else if (change == 'deleted') {\r\n      // filename was removed\r\n    }\r\n    else if (change == 'modified') {\r\n      // filename was changed\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // later on to unwatch, just call the previously returned function\r\n  unwatch();\r\n</pre>  ",
